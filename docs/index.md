In Sanskrit, poetry is poetry (*kāvya*), regardless of whether it takes the form of prose (*gadya*) or verse (*padya*).[^1] What we speak is by default prose (*gadya*); it becomes *padya* when the sounds fall into certain patterns pleasing to the ear -- when they are regulated according to some system.

[^1]:
    English doesn't really have a good equivalent for "kāvya", which covers poems, drama, fiction, etc:
    - The word "literature" is probably closest (e.g. "English literature", "Nobel Prize in Literature"), but it's often used in a wider sense (e.g. scientific literature).
    - The term "belles lettres" was used for a while, but according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belles-lettres&oldid=845020948) it has acquired a narrower and even pejorative sense.
