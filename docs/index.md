In Sanskrit, poetry is poetry (*kāvya*), regardless of whether it takes the form of prose (*gadya*) or verse (*padya*).[^1] What we speak is by default prose (*gadya*); it becomes *padya* when the sounds fall into certain patterns pleasing to the ear -- when they are regulated according to some system.

Here are some examples:

    < Bunch of examples here:
    - Panchachamara, Sragvini, and other such "rhythmic" vRttas
    - Arya and other "rhythmic"(?) mAtrAs
    - non-rhythmic vRttas
    - anuṣtubh
    >

These are often classified into vṛtta and jāti.[^2]

    "Poetry" and "kāvya": English doesn't really have a good equivalent for "kāvya", which covers poems, drama, fiction, etc:
    - The word "literature" is probably closest (e.g. "English literature", "Nobel Prize in Literature"), but it's often used in a wider sense (e.g. scientific literature).
    - The term "belles lettres" was used for a while, but according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belles-lettres&oldid=845020948) it has acquired a narrower and even pejorative sense.

    Classification of metre into categories:

    As the examples show, these regulations/constraints come in varying "degrees":

    - The strongest is *vṛtta*: every syllable has a known "weight" (*laghu* or *guru*), e.g. Kālidāsa's *Meghadūta* where every stanza consists of four lines in the pattern GGGG—LLLLLG—GLGGLGG. (These may be sama-vṛtta, ardha-samavṛtta, or viṣama-vṛtta.)

    - *Almost* all syllables are constrained: the example is Upajāti, where every stanza consists of four lines in the pattern ?GLGGLLGLGG, where ? stands for "either L or G". This one is often analyzed as a mixture of LGLGGLLGLGG and GGLGGLLGLGG (the two options for the initial ?), which are named Upendravajrā and Indravajrā respectively. But the distinction is only analytical.

    - Constraints on the number of mātrā-s (morae) in groups (e.g. Āryā)

    - Constraints on the length of a line, and on a few of the syllables: by which I mean here Anuṣtubh śloka, in which the bulk of Sanskrit literature is composed

    - Constraints only on the total number of syllables in a line (Vaidika chandas).

    - And of course no constraints at all (gadya, prose).


    As a graph:

        gadya → [vaidika → anuṣtubh-śloka] → upajāti → vṛtta
                [       mātrā            ]


        [No constraint] -> [Constraints on the number of ] -> [Constraint on about half the syllables] --> [Constraint on almost all syllables] -> [Constraints on all syllables]
           at all             mAtra (morae) in groups          (e.g. AnuSTubh / zloka, the bulk of           (e.g. upajAti)                          (e.g. kAlidAsa's meghadUta)
          (prose)                (e.g. Arya-shataka)              Sanskrit literature)


                       [Constraint on the total number of syllables]
                           (Vaidika chandas)

    Leaving out Vaidika chandas (Vedic metre) and prose, neither of which counts for our purpose of "padya", this leaves (using examples):

        [arya], [shloka], [upajati], [mAlinI]

    The former (mAtrA metres) are called jAti. The last (mAlinI, etc.) are called vRtta.

    Between the others, for the things in between, different people draw the lines separately.

    Almost everyone else analyses upajAti as a "mixture" of two vRttas, rather than recognizing the constraint itself as being one with that degree of freedom.
    So they have only:

        [mAtrA] -> [shloka] -> [vRtta]

    Many use "jAti" to mean "mAtrA metre", and either put anustubh as a third class of its own, or class it with the vRttas.

    SKB who is the most careful about these, puts everything in jAti, except vRtta. This is a clean system (and also explains why Kedarabhatta covers anustubh in his jAti chapter).
